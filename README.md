#ServiceRest

A REST API that provides calculations for lab sequences. Built with Spring Boot, this API is capable of performing efficient calculations and returns results to its clients.

##Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
###Prerequisites

To run the project, you will need:

    Java 11 or higher
    Maven

##Installation

To set up and run the project:

bash

```
git clone https://github.com/Cesar-Barbosa/labseqapi
cd labseqapi
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

##Running the Tests

Execute the automated tests with:

bash

```
mvn test

```


##Using the API:
###Directly via URL

You can test the API directly by visiting

After clicking on the url below, for further testing replace parameter 7 with any desired value to see the result of the labseq - l(n) sequence. Interactive test interface


[Teste com par√¢metro 7](http://localhost:8080/labseq/7)


##For an interactive testing interface:

Navigate to:

[Teste url](http://localhost:8080/)

Enter the desired value.
Click on the GET button to view the result.

## Hypothesis handling:

Regarding user input: Considering that the user can enter any value in the GET endpoint /labseq/{n}, I formulated a hypothesis that the user enters a negative value. There is a check implemented for this possibility, whereby the user will be informed that the value is invalid.

I introduced a caching system to optimize subsequent calculations, I verified that the values do not change so storing them for quick reuse is effective and does not introduce errors.

As for security we have spring.security.user.name and spring.security.user.password, it is an authentication model that can be implemented but for testing purposes it is in /labseqapi/src/main/resources/application.properties.

In the documentation Swagger has been included for visual and interactive interface so that end users or developers can interact with the API.

Question validated:
In the API response there is an issue of a response to very large integers that cannot be represented by a standard integer data type. In the context of the code, there should be concern about very deep calls in the calculate function in the LabseqService class due to the recursive nature of the function.

Tests to check assumptions have also been included to cover scenarios.


##Swagger Documentation

The API's endpoints and details are well documented and can be accessed via Swagger at:


[Swagger documentation](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)

[Swagger analysis](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/labseq-controller/getLabseqUsingGET)


##Security

The API is secured with basic authentication:

    Username: admin
    Password: admin

Please note that these credentials are just a template that was used for testing purposes.

###Built With

    Spring Boot - The framework used
